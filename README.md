# Huffman-Coding-Implementation
This C program implements Huffman coding, a popular algorithm used for data compression. Huffman coding is a lossless compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies, with more frequent characters having shorter codes. The program constructs a Huffman tree from the input characters and their frequencies, then prints the Huffman codes for each character. These codes can be used to compress and decompress data efficiently.

## Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:<br>
Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
Compile the `huffman.c` file using a C compiler.<br>
Run the compiled executable.<br>
Provide input characters and their frequencies when prompted.<br>
The program will output the Huffman codes for each character.
